To really irradiate every corner in the apartment adequately with WLAN, another WLAN AP is to be put into operation. Additionally I want to change from the [Tomato Firmware](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_(firmware)>) to [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/), because OpenWrt is more up to date and has better extensibility via its package management.

The [wiki page for Archer A7](https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/archer_a7_v5) of OpenWrt contains an image which can be installed via the web interface of the router. I followed the following steps:

1. Power the router
1. Connect computer to one of the ethernet ports
1. Call `http://192.168.0.1` in the browser
1. Set administrator password of the router
1. Navigate to the `Advanced > System Tools > Firmware Upgrade` page
1. Select firmware file from router wiki page <br /> ![Dialog from TP-Link interface](tplink-upgrade-dialog.png)
1. After a few minutes, the Luci web interface can be accessed from OpenWrt via `http://192.168.1.1`. It may be necessary to request a new assignment from the DHCP server.
