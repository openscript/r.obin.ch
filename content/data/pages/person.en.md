# Great to meet you! I'm Robin.

My natural habitat are all kind of outdoor environments. The modes of transport vary between cycling and hiking. Greater distance I try to cover by train. I like to jog along the Rhine and dancing, even though I'm not gifted with talent.

I try to discover our precious planet spontaneously and without leaving my footstep. Usually I'm open and very happy to meet strangers. Contrary to the outdoors I like the world of bits and bytes. Recently I got into teaching and enjoying this.

Problems I see as a challenge and I like to tackle them. It's fun for me to fiddle out creative solutions or break it down into small manageable pieces.
