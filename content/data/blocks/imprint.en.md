### Data protection

Due to legal requirements we are obliged in certain cases to pass on your personal data to third parties. This is the case, for example, if there is a suspicion of a crime or misuse of this website. I will only pass on your data to law enforcement authorities on the basis of a court order. However, if it is in my own interest that an abuse is cleared up because the users or the site operator himself is one of the aggrieved parties, the judicial order can also be waived.
