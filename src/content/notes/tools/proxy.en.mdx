title: Proxy
---

In contrast to virtual private networks proxies act an intermediary between your device and another network or the internet. Sometimes cooperations enforce to use proxies to access the internet.

## Configuration

Usually proxies are configured and act on the application layer. Thus it can be fiddely to set them up uniformly for all network traffic coming out of a device.

### Linux

On Linux most of the applications apply proxies they find in environment variables such as `http_proxy` or `socks_proxy`.

#### sudo

/etc/sudoers:

```txt
Defaults env_keep += "ftp_proxy http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy"
```

#### docker

/etc/docker/daemon.json:


```json
{
  "proxies": {
    "http-proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:1080",
    "https-proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:1080",
    "no-proxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,::1"
  }
}
```

~/.docker/config.json:

```json
{
 "proxies": {
   "default": {
     "allProxy": "socks://172.17.0.1:1080",
     "httpProxy": "http://172.17.0.1:1080",
     "httpsProxy": "http://172.17.0.1:1080",
     "noProxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,::1"
   }
 }
}
```
