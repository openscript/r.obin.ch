## Workstations

History of my workstations sorted by age:

### MK0: Custom built desktop

### HP Compaq 2230s

- Intel Core 2 Duo T6570, 2GB RAM, 250GB HDD, 12.1" WXGA
- Vista Home
- Bought at 23.04.2009 for CHF 862.00

This was the first laptop I've owned. Windows Vista Home was horrible and I replaced it with [CrunchBang Linux](https://crunchbang.org/).

### MK1: Self-built mini desktop

### MK2: Self-built gaming computer

### Lenovo ThinkPad T470p

- Without OS
- Bought at September 2014 for CHF 1'440.00

A great laptop, but in the beginning the Nvidia graphics card was a pain to use with Linux. At some point I've upgraded the RAM to 32 GB. I've used this laptop for about 6 years and it was just recently passed on to my mum.
