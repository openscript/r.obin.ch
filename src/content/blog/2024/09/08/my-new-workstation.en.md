After three and a half years, I'm about to replace my Dell XPS 13 9310. Over the years I've used this laptop almost everyday and it started to show its age. The keys foil or whatever it is, starts to have blisters and come off. Also the battery has degraded. Maybe I going to make a post usage review of it, I don't know yet.

Anyway, I've got my hands on a new Lenovo P14s of the 4th generation. Actually I'm happy how the Dell performed, also the previous XPS I had was okay, but everything that came after the 9310 didn't really impress me. I especially don't like the touch keys.
