Here you can find information about this website. Among other things, it explains the goals I am pursuing with this website.

## Goals

I have set the following goals for the realisation of this website:

- **Small Web**: With this website I would like to contribute to the small web. The term "small web" typically stands for small, non-commercial websites run by individuals. It is also about sharing knowledge and creativity without relying on advertising or tracking. [^1] [^2]
- **Handmade**: The content of this website is handmade. This means that I do not use artificial intelligence and the content is my own creation.
- **Personal**: The content reflects my personality and interests. It's about sharing my thoughts and ideas and discussing them with others.

## Technologies

The source code of the website can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/openscript/r.obin.ch).

This website is built with the following technologies and tools:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [FontSource](https://fontsource.org)
- [PageFind](https://pagefind.app)
