Great to meet you here! I'm Robin.

From a young age, I was fascinated by technology. Especially computers and software development caught my interest. I enjoy developing web applications and applications for mobile devices. In the future I would like to focus on these topics and expand my knowledge.

It's easy and fun for me to work with colleagues to move a project forward and achieve our goals. I can take responsibility for a small team and lead them with clear instructions and agile project management.

Away from the world of bits and bytes, I enjoy being outdoors. The means of transport vary between cycling and walking. I try to cover longer distances by train. I love non-competitive jogging and sleeping under the stars. I try to discover our precious planet spontaneously and without taking my feet off the ground. I'm usually open-minded and very happy to meet strangers.

I see problems as a challenge and like to tackle them. I enjoy coming up with creative solutions or breaking them down into small, manageable pieces.
